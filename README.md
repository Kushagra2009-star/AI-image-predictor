This is my very first coding project in the journey to the top UK university, i have copleted this with help of Tensorflow and Keras to built a beginner friendly neural network to classify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset
HERE I AM GOING TO TELL YOU..... :blush:

## 1- what does this project do :thinking:

description- This is the neural network built up with the help of 'Tensor flow' and 'Keras' to classify the handwritten digits from MNIST("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset")

## 2- LIBRARIES I USED. :point_down:

### 1- _**Tensor flow**_ - it is the open source mechine learning and deep learning library by google that helps us to built,classify,train the model and also used for evaluation

• <ins>in my project this is the foundation to run neural network to recognise handwritten digits from MNIST dataset</ins>

### 2- _**Keras**_- it is a high level API used to make deep learning model easily with few lines of code

• <ins>in my project i used to built the layers of neural networks
like- ("DENSE"), ("FLATTEN"). compile the model with an optimizer and loss fuction and to train it i used [.fit()] and for evaluation process[,evaluate()]</ins>

### 3- _**NumPy**_- This is the fundamental library used for numerical computing that helps to handle large number of mathematical operation 

• <ins>in my project is used it for scaling my pixel values and to reshape images for training and prediction</ins>

### 4- _**MatplotLib**_-  it is the fantastic python library for image visualization and for plottimg graphs and charts
 
• <ins>in my project i used [MatplotLib.pyplot(plt)] to show images and display prediction</ins>
